POLLAPP: HOW TO USE

This is a guide on how to use PollApp. This guide pertains to the version of PollApp current to
December 2, 2021, meaning in the future, when the app is updated, these instructions may no longer
apply.

When you open PollApp, you are met with the Login page. If it is your first time using PollApp,
you will not have any user information and will have to proceed to the sign up page. Click where
it says "sign up" to create an account.

The signup form should be pretty self-explanatory. Enter your e-mail (or come up with a username)
and make sure your password match, then press sign up to be taken to the main screen of the app.

When you return to PollApp on the same device, you can use the information you signed up with to
log in again.

Now that you are on the main screen of the activity, the first thing you see is the "My Polls"
dashboard where the user can see the list of the polls they have created, active or inactive.
This scrollable dashboard is filled with placeholder data for the time being.

Click on the "Hamburger" Icon to open up the navigation drawer. This is where you can navigate to
other parts of the app. You can click on the items in the drawer to navigate to them. You can navi-
gate between the My Polls, Find Poll, and New Poll sections of the app. At this time, The Find Poll
section is empty, and the New Poll section isn't fully functional. However, you can add new "questions"
to a poll using the floating action button in the bottom right corner of the screen.
